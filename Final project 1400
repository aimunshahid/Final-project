//Aimun Shahid- it's guessing number game, asking for the user input to guess the number I have in mind/ or code.
// I used a while loop because repeats asking the user for a number but as well as if they want to play again. 
//instead of writing it over and over again in the code. THe while loop will that with yes or no condition.So the loop runs as long as the user is type yes(y) but once the user enters no(n), the game finishes.
//also if they enter a number that's two high it'll print that out and if it's too low it'll print that in a while loop. It helps the program run smoothly without making the user suffer. So in stead it's runs everything for the user except the user will only
//type y , n, and a number. 
//
